# FreeCodeCamp React And Data Visualization Projects

## Contents

## Comments
This repository will contain all the projects relating to my FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification

## Notes
I'm trying to challange myself a bit here and forcing myself to use git for these relitivly small projects. Additionally I am trying to using a single respoitory to store a number of different, and potentially unrelated, projects.
Both of these are an attempt to get me to learn more git/github and are probably not the most efficent way of doing things.
